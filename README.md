## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- link multiple user accounts together
- generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules
