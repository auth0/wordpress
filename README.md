Please see the [installation docs](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/installation) for detailed instructions on how to get started with Login by Auth0.

## Getting Started

Please see the [configuration docs](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/configuration) for instructions on how to configure Login by Auth0 for your site. Once configured, you'll want to test:

- Existing user login
- New user signup (if allowed)
- SSO login (if used)
- Additional features like MFA, user migration, etc.

We recommend testing on a staging/development site first using a separate Auth0 Application before putting the plugin live on your production site. See the **[Support](#support--feedback)** section below if you have any questions or issues during setup.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- link multiple user accounts together
- generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules
